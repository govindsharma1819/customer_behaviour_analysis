Data Analytics End-to-End Project
Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow, starting from raw data ingestion to business-ready insights.
The work covers data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL querying on relational databases, dashboard creation, and stakeholder presentation.

The objective is to showcase practical skills used by data analysts in real-world projects, not just theoretical knowledge.

Dataset

Source: Public / provided dataset

Format: CSV

Size: Medium-sized dataset suitable for analysis

Contains both numerical and categorical features

Includes missing values and inconsistencies handled during preprocessing

(Dataset details can be updated based on the actual data used.)

Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

PostgreSQL (SQL queries & data analysis)

MySQL Server (SQL querying & validation)

Power BI (Interactive dashboard creation)

Gamma (Presentation / PPT creation)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Project Workflow / Steps

Data Loading

Imported dataset using Python

Business-focused queries for KPIs

Dashboard Development

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard

Included KPIs, trends, and filters

Designed for clarity and decision-making

Presentation

Created a concise PPT using Gamma

Summarized problem statement, approach, insights, and outcomes

Dashboards

The Power BI dashboard includes:

Key performance indicators (KPIs)
